# Werewolf

Werewolf - The Game -
All your friends suddenly live together in one eerie village. By day, you band together to uncover the werewolves lurking in the shadows, but by night, the werewolves silently prey on unsuspecting villagers.
But what if your village is actually spread out accross the world?

This is my own little Dart implementation of the game, just so you can make the world your village :)
